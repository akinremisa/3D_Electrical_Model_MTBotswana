The 3D MT model (Electircal_Conductivity_Model.rho) was written by ModEM software (A modular system for inversion of electromagnetic geophysical data) in WS format. 
The data inversion input data includes topography data (Measured_Data.dat)
The predicted data after the inversion is given in Predicted_Data.dat
The model residual file is given in Model_Residual.res
The files can be view using notepad++
Python toolbox an be used to plot the data and models (e.g., MTpy - Python toolbox for Magnetotellurics) 


The freely available Southern African Magnetotelluric Experiment (SAMTEX) data covering Botswana was used to obtain the electrical conductivity model.
The data is accessible via https://www.mtnet.info/data/samtex/samtex.html
